Can you generate a changelog that's enjoyable by final users of the app, using this PR: https://github.com/openfoodfacts/smooth-app/pull/5615. 
- You should go explore each merged PR, read what it's about, leverage before/after screenshots to create visual storytelling. 
- You should discard everything that does not have a material impact on user experience, or user's perception of the app. 
- You should try to group everything by larger theme (often the PRs will have labels to help you with that)
- The output should be formatted as markdown, the images should hotlink their initial URL.
